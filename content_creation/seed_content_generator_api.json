            "string": "My Review of Stephane Maarek's AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate Course\nTip\nHere begins my series of AWS guides! I'll start by sharing an in-depth review of my experience with Stephane Maarek's AWS SysOps course on Udemy. For anyone considering this course, hereâs a detailed breakdown of my thoughts:\n\nPros\nClear and Understandable Accent: StÃ©phane Maarek's voice is exceptionally clear even for people who might struggle in English, this eliminates the need to speed up the videos or rely on captions (according to me) although do note that the captions provided on udemy can be quite a bit inaccurate at times. His straightforward delivery helps maintain focus on the content.\n\nTransparency with Billing: One thing I appreciated is that Stephane shows his actual AWS bill. When he accidentally incurred charges while demonstrating services, he took it in stride and shared the details. This honesty gave me a real sense of what costs could look like if I followed his exact steps.\n\nCrystal-Clear Diagrams: Stephane's use of simple, crisp diagrams is outstanding. Each visual clearly illustrates the concept heâs teaching, making complex topics easier to understand.\n\nOccasional Real-Life Scenarios: Although these are limited, Stephane does introduce real-world examples when relevant. For instance, he sometimes recommends services other than AWSâs own suggestions if they perform better, or points out confusing naming conventions (e.g., AWS Cognito for user authentication, which might not match AWSâs naming expectations). These insights help clear up misconceptions.\n\nExcellent Networking Tips: Stephane provides an incredibly efficient method for calculating CIDR blocks and other networking shortcuts. He prepares students for the difficulty of this section but still manages to simplify it brilliantly.\n\nGuidance on Discounts and Exam Prep: One of the course sections provides valuable tips on obtaining AWS discounts, additional exam time for eligible students, and advice for non-AWS users. These tips are practical and directly beneficial for certification candidates.\n\nUseful Warnings and Summaries: Stephane often warns students about complex sections ahead, such as when discussing CloudFront before fully diving into it. This heads-up approach keeps learners oriented and ready for whatâs coming.\n\nCons\nLimited to Exam Preparation and Beginners: While this course is excellent for beginners or those preparing for the certification exam, it lacks depth for real-world applications. Based on what Iâve seen of Adrill Cantrellâs course (albeit only trial videos), Stephaneâs course doesnât dive as deeply into the practical skills a working SysOps admin might need.\n\nOver-Reliance on Presentation Reading: In the early stages of the course, Stephane often just reads directly from his PowerPoint slides without adding context or explanation, which might frustrate beginners.\n\nHeavy Use of AWS Documentation: Much of the course content appears to be lifted directly from AWS documentation. While this ensures accuracy, it would have been beneficial if he elaborated more on the material to provide additional insights.\n\nReused Content from Previous Courses: A significant portion of the course (particularly networking) is directly imported from Stephaneâs other AWS courses. While this helps save time, over 50% of the content felt recycled, which can be disappointing for learners expecting new, specialized material in a SysOps context.\n\nVerdict\nOverall, Iâd recommend this course primarily for beginners or those focused on certification preparation. If you're looking for a deep dive into practical, real-world skills, this might not be the course for you. Based on my experience, Iâd give it a 3 to 3.5 out of 5.\n\nIf you're considering this course, I hope my review provides some clarity! And for those interested, I'll soon be posting more about my study journey, resources, and additional insights from my cloud certification path. Stay tuned!\n\nu/stephanemaarek\n\n\nUpvote\n4\n\nDownvote\n\n1\nGo to comments\n\n\nShare\nShare\nAdd a comment\nSort by:\n\nBest\n\nSearch Comments\nExpand comment search\nComments Section\nu/GlosuuLang avatar\nGlosuuLang\nâ¢\n5m ago\nâ¢\nI think pretty much all content creators recycle materials if they have several courses out. It's the logical thing to do, since there's overlap between certifications. Something that could be useful is to mark if the lecture is present in other courses, or potentially mark it complete if you took it in another course. But it's usually a good idea to refresh an old lecture anyway."
